# ðŸ“˜ Python-Programs Repo

Welcome to the **Python Programs** repository! This is your central workspace for all class exercises, starter templates, and final solutions.

## ðŸ§­ Purpose

* Host **starter code templates** (with TODOs) for students to work on
* Share **completed solutions** for reference and debugging
* Store **datasets / input files** (e.g. `.txt`, `.csv`)

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Structure (example)

```
python-programs/
â”œâ”€â”€ case_notes.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ visits.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ detective_task.py
â”œâ”€â”€ guess_number.py
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ museum_report.txt
â””â”€â”€ â€¦ (other daysâ€™ tasks and solutions)
```

## ðŸš€ How Students Use It

1. **Clone/fork** the repo
2. Pick a task folder/file (e.g. `detective_task.py`)
3. Open the **starter template**, fill in TODOs, run locally
4. Compare with the **solution version** in the repo
5. Submit via pull request or share your version for review

## âœ… Best Practices

* Always create a **branch** before working
* Commit often with meaningful messages ("Completed regex part", not just "done")
* Do **not** push broken code â€” test before submitting
* Use the solution files for debugging **after trying yourself**
